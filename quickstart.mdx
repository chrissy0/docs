## Create your account

Head over to [the signup page](https://productlab.so/login/) and create an account. Make sure to check your spam folder, as our emails sometimes end up there. You'll receive a $5 signup bonus, so you can get started with generating images right away.

## Define your desired images

After signup, you'll be redirected to the ProductLab.so Studio. On desktop devices, you will see a sidebar with a form, allowing you to define your desired images. On mobile, you will see a _Generate ✨_ button. Clicking it will reveal the same form. Let's go through the available form fields.

### Positive Prompt (Product)

In this field, describe the product you're trying to put into a new setting. For example, `a soap dispenser`, `a book`, `a knife` or `a suitcase`. Keep it short, without unnecessary detail. For example, entering `a kitchen knife` rather than `a knife` might influence the image generation, putting your product in a kitchen.

### Positive Prompt (Background)

This field works similarly to the previous one. Just describe your desired background. For example, `on a marble plate, in a flower field`, `on a wooden desk`, `on a kitchen counter, top down view` or `at an airport`. The product prompt and the background prompt together should form a complete sentence, e.g. `a soap dispenser on a marble plate, in a flower field`, `a book on a wooden desk`, `a knife on a kitchen counter, top down view` or `a suitcase at an airport`.

### Negative Prompt

This field is optional. If ProductLab is putting undesired objects in the generated images, mention them here to prevent them from showing up. For example, if you don't want any people to show up in the images, type `human, person, people` (comma separated).

### Image Upload

Upload an image of your product. Make sure it's fully visible (not cut off) and the primary subject of the image. We currently support `.png`, `.jpg` and `.jpeg` images up to 5MB. The image does not have to have a white background, in fact our AI is often better able to realistically place an object in a new setting if it has some information on the real background, such as shadows.

### Number of Images to Generate

Enter the number of images to generate. It's a good idea to start with a low number to test a few different configurations, then ramping it up to find the ideal image.

### Resolution

Select the target solution of the generated image.

## Generating your images

If you're happy with your inputs, you can hit _Generate ✨_ to start the image generation process. Generating images cost $0.02/image. It will take somewhere between 2 to 5 minutes to generate your images. You can feel free to leave the site and come back later. Once done, the images will appear in the main panel with a watermark.

## Unlocking images

If you've generated an image you're happy with, you can unlock it with the click of a button for $1.00. You can then immediately download it without watermark in full resolution. It's yours to keep forever, and all the rights to the image go over to you.
